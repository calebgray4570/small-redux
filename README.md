# Small Redux Tutorial

### Setup

`git clone` this repo <br/>
`npm install` <br/>
`npm start`


### Instructions

No work required! The workflow for this project is like this: <br/>
<br/>
`src/ducks/reducer.js --> src/store.js --> src/components/App.jsx`
<br/>
<br/>
and that's typically the flow I follow to set up the first reducer/actions.
